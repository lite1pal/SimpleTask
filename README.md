You have a lot of things to do each day, small and large ones,
but sometimes you just forget a couple of them throughout the day
which leads to unsatisfied feeling at the end of the day.
And then you find out about task management apps, think
that you will use it easily right away and your life's gonna change.
But seeing a lot of these advanced features, a bunch of ways
to set up your tasks makes it intimidating, exhausting and overwhelming.
If you are like me who struggled with the same problem all the time,
wait no more to try a very simple to use task management app
that i created in the first place for myself, and if it helps me, will help you as well.
